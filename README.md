## 📋 Introduction

In basketball, there's a classic debate: **"Does defense win championships?"** 🛡️ or does a powerful offense 🏹 lead the way?  
Some believe **defense** holds the key to success by stopping opponents from scoring. Others argue that a strong **offense** is a better strategy. But who really has the edge in NBA Finals history?

This project dives into NBA data 📊 from 1980 to 2019 to analyze and answer this question: **Which is more crucial for championship teams—offense or defense?**

---

## 🔍 Objective

Our goal is to:

- 🏅 Compare **offensive-oriented** and **defensive-oriented** NBA championship teams
- 👊 Determine which focus has historically won more championships
- 🏀 Analyze final series stats to understand what defines a winning team

---

## 🏁 Project Overview

The study will cover **39 NBA Finals series** to evaluate:

- **Points Allowed per Game** 📉 as a measure of defensive strength
- **Points Scored per Game** 📈 as an indicator of offensive prowess
- Key factor analysis for **sweeps** (4-0 wins) as an indicator of a dominant championship team

Our methodology centers on examining **field goal percentages** 📈 and overall scoring statistics 📊, with an emphasis on identifying whether defense or offense plays a decisive role in each final series.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
   - We sourced the data from [Rdatasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daverosenman/nba-finals-team-stats) 🌐.
   - The dataset includes stats from the **champion** and **runner-up** teams for each final series.

### 2️⃣ Metrics for Analysis
   - **Defensive-Oriented Teams** 🛡️:
     - Measured by **points allowed per game** (lower points allowed = stronger defense)
   - **Offensive-Oriented Teams** 🏹:
     - Measured by **points scored per game** (higher points scored = stronger offense)

### 3️⃣ Defining a Championship Team
   - Teams with **4 wins** in a series are designated as champions 🏆.
   - **"Sweeps"** (4-0 wins) are given high priority as they show unmatched strength over opponents.

## 📊 Key Findings (To be completed)

Findings will include insights on:

- The balance between **defense and offense** in championship success 🏆
- Noteworthy trends in **field goal percentages** and **scoring patterns** 📈
- Key takeaways on what defines a successful team in high-stakes games

---

## 🚫 Limitations

- **Injury Factor**: Player injuries, which can impact championship outcomes, are **not accounted for** due to their unpredictability.
- **Primary Stats**: Focus is limited to **points scored** and **field goal percentage** to maintain clarity.
